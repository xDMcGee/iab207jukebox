            About Jukebox Jams
        </div>
        <div class="bd-paragraph text-center">
            We here at Jukebox Jams have always been so passionate about how you listen to and absorb music. 

We go through each day, nowadays, being able to blast music through every medium, and stream it through just as many companies. 

But we’ve grown up with a deep appreciation for all types of music, especially different platforms too! 

We’re used to waking up to Rumors by Fleetwood Mac every sunday morning, after hearing dad put the needle onto the worn vinyl. We’re used to hearing the familiar scratches on a Bruce Springsteen LP. 

We’re used to the quality and beauty of Vinyls. 

So we here at Jukebox Jams have decided to share our childhoods with the world, and continue to share the allure of our favourite form of music.
